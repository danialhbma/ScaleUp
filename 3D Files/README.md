### About the zip file 
1) Each zip file contains folders with "Inventory", "Weighing Scale" and "Button Stickers".
2) To fabricate the casing for both inventory and weighing scale, you will require a slicer software, such as CURA and a 3D printer.
3) CAD step files are included if you need to make any edits according to your component specifications. 
4) If your computer has a slicer software, you will be able to view the STL files in the folders. 
5) Slice the STL and upload the gcode to your 3D printer
6) Folder "Button Stickers" contains an illustrator file of button stickers design. These stickers are pasted on the membrane keypad to provide 
more clarity on the functions for each button.
